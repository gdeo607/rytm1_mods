        | Mod 0006 - compressor gain-reduction preview.
        |
        | One more compressor page carrying a scrolling estimate of the compressor's
        | gain reduction, in two layouts FUNC + the page key switches between: the
        | level, threshold and GR together, or GR alone with 0 dB at the top. It is
        | stock page 11, listed twice in the view's page vector rather than a new
        | page id, so stock's parameter lookup, title and encoder mapping are
        | inherited and the entries are told apart by the view's selected index at
        | +0x8c, in the draw slot.
        |
        | The estimate, twinned offline by tools/comp/stub_model.py, which reads
        | its constants from this file: the eight voices summed with the gain law
        | recovered in re/subsystems/compressor-hardware.md, a peak
        | detector with a 5 ms decay, a static curve that THR slides along the
        | level axis (static_gr), and one attack / release pole. It is an
        | estimate of GR, not a measurement: there is no readback of the analog
        | compressor's actual gain.
        |
        | The input model: each voice split by
        | its pan and dropped when off the main bus, the per-slot trims, the PRE
        | delay and reverb returns, and the master distortion, summed per side.
        | The detector takes the louder side, as the compressor does.
        |
        | Known departures from the model:
        |   - the returns are paired with the voices of the same block, about
        |     six blocks (4 ms) early. Aligning them needs about 2 KB of return
        |     history. It shows only where a sustained tone overlaps its echo.
        |   - POST returns are not modelled. DIST symmetry is, as a bias and a
        |     gain, except near SYM 0 and 127 with DIST near 0, where the
        |     hardware all but mutes (calibration.toml, [distortion]).
        |   - each SEQ setting's sidechain response is two first-order sections
        |     (sidech, in cave3), fitted to the hardware's own response swept 35
        |     Hz to 9 kHz (calibration.toml, [sidechain]): within 0.1 to 0.4 dB
        |     rms. The sample path's 24 kHz rate leaves nothing above 12 kHz.
        |     Past the filter, each SEQ is only a level offset.
        |   - the static curve is evaluated once a block against the detector, and
        |     the pole is stepped once a block with the closed form for 32 samples.
        |     That is exact while the target is steady and lags a little when it is
        |     not.
        |   - the estimate holds reduction too long into quiet passages.

        | Every calibrated constant and table: generated from calibration.toml by
        | tools/comp/calib_tables.py. Each table below is a macro from it.

        | The per-side input model (compressor-hardware.md, "Voices: level, pan
        | and routing"). The VCA words are uint16 per PHYSICAL voice, written by
        | 0x401098d4 earlier in this same interrupt; SLOT_MAP takes a physical
        | voice to its receive slot. The route byte is packed from physical
        | voices 7,6,5,4,0,1,2,3, MSB first, so voice p is bit p for 4..7 and bit
        | 3-p for 0..3, and a set bit takes the voice off the main bus.

        | The PRE returns. Each buffer is 32 interleaved L/R long frames,
        | written by the effects call just before the detour, so they hold this
        | block's output. The PRE gains are (2 * return level * FX track level)^2
        | in Q31, built at 0x4010e8a0; a return set to POST clears its PRE word,
        | so a POST return drops out here on its own. The consumer at 0x4010eb26
        | sends -(gain * return) >> 8 to the DAC, so the return reaches the
        | analog bus in voice-slot units only through a constant, measured with
        | MAIN carrying returns alone (calibrate.py input). The constants start
        | at the firmware's negation and the sum's 1/8 headroom.

        | The master distortion, from the voice-path probe of
        | 2026-09-21, refit by calibrate.py dist. It is a gain set by DIST and
        | then an asymmetric saturation, present at DIST 0 as well, applied to
        | each side of voices plus PRE returns. DIST's amount is 0x8000fbce,
        | 8.8, which the interrupt doubles into the analog control block at
        | 0x40121306; read back on the device at 0 and 64 against CC 70.
        | Its symmetry is 0x8000fbd0, 64 at centre, and the saturation below
        | was measured at 64 only.
        |
        | disttab is the gain against DIST 0 at DIST 0, 32, 64, 96 and 128, Q12;
        | 128 extends the 96..127 slope so 127 lands on its measured 7.127. It is
        | applied as g/8 in Q31, and DIST_HEADROOM takes the 8 back out.
        |
        | The saturation after the gain: analog, y = x / (1 + |x/c|^12)^(1/12),
        | c = +0.68 / -0.72 in MAIN units at the model's calibration. Fitted on
        | the peak-detector metric through the pre-saturation tap at MIX 0, where
        | MAIN is the dry signal the compressor receives (2026-09-22): the same
        | curve at every DIST from 16 to 127 on a kick, a tonal and a hat
        | pattern, the hats about 1 dB earlier. DIST is drive
        | into it. Here c is over 90.49, in Q31, as the side sum carries it.
        | Fitted at DIST symmetry 64; away from 64, satur_sym adds a bias before
        | it and a gain after it.

        |
        | Confirmed on hardware 2026-09-21 by reading the block back on the
        | device against eight distinct known values; the cal build's record
        | reads it back on every block.
        |
        | The firmware agrees. 0x8000fbd4 is passed as a pointer to 0x4010e1a0
        | beside the analog control block; that consumer reads +0 as a threshold
        | (12288 - v/2 into a DAC), +10 through an exponential as a gain, and +12
        | and +14 as two multipliers into it - MUP, MIX and VOL. It never touches
        | +2..+8, which is why the order within those four needed measuring.
        |
        | Only the first five are read here. MUP, MIX and VOL are downstream of
        | the gain computer and cannot change gain reduction: VOL is measured at
        | a 0.15 dB spread across its entire range (compressor-hardware.md). MUP

        | Level, VOL, velocity and accent are all already in the voice slot; only
        | pan and a per-voice gain are applied after the tap. Hardware, 2026-09-20:
        | the twelve-channel USB stream is this same receive buffer, so the slots
        | were fitted against the MAIN pair offline.
        |
        | Pan keeps gL + gR = S for every pan, where S is a per-slot constant:
        | equal on six slots, 0.85 dB lower on slots 5 and 6, which read that much
        | hot (compressor-hardware.md). So a voice's contribution to L+R does not
        | depend on pan, and K = S of track 1 is folded into CAL_Q8.
        |
        | The compressor does not see L+R. It applies one gain to both sides,
        | driven by max(|L|,|R|). So the two sides are built separately, from the
        | split p = wL/(wL+wR) of the VCA words and the trim on slots 5 and 6,
        | and the louder feeds the gain computer.
        | Per-slot side coefficients, rebuilt every block because pan and routing
        | can change at any time. For physical voice p in slot s:
        |   f      = wL / (wL + wR), Q15
        |   cL[s]  = f * trim[s]            } Q28, which is 1/8 in Q31: the
        |   cR[s]  = trim[s] - cL[s]        } eight-voice sum's headroom
        | and both zero when the voice is off the main bus or both words are zero.
        | The words lead the audio by four ticks, so a p-locked pan change is
        | briefly early.
